I had the opportunity to work on a project to migrate a 20-year-old legacy ArcMap plugin to ArcGIS Pro. I rewrote the project using C# and the ArcGIS Pro SDK, while working with WPF and the MVVC pattern. It was a challenging but rewarding experience, and I gained valuable insight and practical skills for maintaining and refactoring legacy systems.
