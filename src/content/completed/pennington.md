I had the opportunity to work on a machine learning project with a group of students from LSU over the summer, with support from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center. Our goal was to predict appendicular lean muscle mass (ALM) based on body measurements collected using one of Pennington's machines. We were successful in developing a neural network model that was more accurate than a linear model developed in a previous research effort at the center. We are currently writing a paper on our findings and hope to publish it in the near future.
