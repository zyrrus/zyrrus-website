I had the opportunity to lead a team in the development of DropNote, a full-stack file sharing platform for professors. As the team lead, I oversaw the project from start to finish and ensured that we were meeting our milestones and delivering a high-quality product. I also served as the software architect, designing the overall structure and flow of the application.

In addition to my technical roles, I also served as the UI designer for the project. I used Figma to design a modern and minimal interface that was easy for professors to use. We built the platform using Firebase and Flutter, which allowed us to create a fast and reliable application.
