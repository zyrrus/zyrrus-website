I'm currently working on a personal project called Flurry, a language learning app that aims to combine the best features of the most popular apps while remaining free with an optional, unobtrusive paid plan. I spent much of the first month researching and testing a handful of the most popular language learning apps and teaching methods to gather ideas and inspiration for Flurry. I'm excited to begin developing this project further and to bring a unique and valuable language learning experience to users.
