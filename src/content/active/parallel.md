Parallel is a platform that connects educators and animators to create new educational content for YouTube or other platforms. This was my first project using React, Firebase, and Figma, and I gained valuable experience in full-stack development as a result. This project has since been revived with a complete overhaul in the works. An MVP of the redesigned app is currently a work in progress. I'm using Next.js (hosted on Vercel), Prisma (with a MySQL database hosted on PlanetScale), tRPC, Tailwind, and a little Radix UI.
