Hi, my name is Zeke Abshire, and I am currently a Software Developer Intern at Vigilus (formerly Crimer). I'm proficient in developing full-stack, cross-platform mobile apps and web apps, software architecture planning, and UI/UX design.

In my current role at Vigilus, I am actively contributing to the rebranding effort by working on the company's website. In my free time, I enjoy pursuing personal projects, playing musical instruments, learning new languages, and experimenting with various Linux distributions, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, please don't hesitate to contact me.
