Hi, my name is Zeke Abshire, and I am currently a Software Developer at Vigilus. I'm proficient in developing full-stack, cross-platform mobile apps and web apps, software architecture planning, and UI/UX design.

In my current role at Vigilus, I'm a senior developer working on anything from React web apps and admin portals to Flutter and React Native mobile apps. I've contributed to project planning sessions, mentored junior developers, and led development teams on several projects. In my free time, I enjoy developing personal projects, playing musical instruments, learning new languages, and experimenting with Linux distributions, and I am always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow as a developer.

If you have any questions or would like to learn more about my work, please don't hesitate to contact me.
