# Appendicular Lean Mass Prediction Using PyTorch

## Introduction

In the summer of 2022, a team of students and researchers from the LSU Math Department embarked on a captivating journey funded by Pennington Biomedical Research Center. The goal of this group was to enhance the findings of [one of Pennington's research papers](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajcnut.2023.02.003). We aimed to elevate the accuracy of predicting Appendicular Lean Mass (ALM) using neural networks, a departure from the original study's approach involving least absolute shrinkage and LASSO regression.

## The Team

The team consisted of around five undergraduates and two graduate students led by a postdoc and a professor from the department. Several members of the team had additional concentrations in related fields like computer science, engineering, and biology.

## Methodology

1. **Visualizing and understanding the Data:**
   Employing visualization tools, such as Matplotlib and Seaborn, helped us gain valuable insights into the dataset.

2. **Data Cleaning and Anomaly Detection:**
   PyCaret was our primary tool in streamlining anomaly detection and data cleaning processes.

3. **Building the Network with PyTorch:**
   We constructed a neural network using PyTorch. We almost immediately found promising results, even before optimizing the mode.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning:**
   We fine-tuned the model's predictive performance through meticulous hyperparameter optimization.

## Results and Achievements

Continuing our efforts into the Fall, our work received recognition as a featured poster during [Obesity Week](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/oby.23626#oby23626-sec-1177).
