# Revolutionizing Educational Content Creation with Parallel

## Introduction

Parallel addresses the gap of collaboration between aspiring educational content creators and educators. The platform facilitates a collaborative space, where educators contribute their domain knowledge, and content creators bring concepts to life through animations and visualizations, fostering the creation of high-quality educational videos.

## Development

### Inspiration

The idea behind Parallel found further validation in a moment during [Grant Sanderson's 3blue1brown podcast](https://youtu.be/SUMLKweFAYk?si=ugfBwlshpvPh-RnL&t=2354). This solidified my vision to empower educators and content creators to join forces in creating high-quality educational content.

### Technology Stack and Deployment

I wanted to choose a stack that gave me the opportunity to explore new tools. The [T3 stack](https://create.t3.gg) (comprising of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), [tRPC](https://trpc.io/), [NextAuth](https://next-auth.js.org/), and [Prisma with MySQL](https://www.prisma.io/)) presented an exciting chance to learn cutting-edge technologies mixed in with tools I was already familiar with.

The site was hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), along with [PlanetScale](https://planetscale.com/) for the database. This combination not only provided a robust foundation for development but also ensured scalability and performance.

## Lessons Learned

- **Strategic Technology Choices:** This project would have been substantially more daunting if it weren't for the tools I used. The T3 stack was fully responsible for enabling me (a solo developer occasionally working between classes) to...

  - design the UI,
  - plan out the database models,
  - build the front-end,
  - build the back-end,
  - set up automated deployment, and finaly,
  - deploy the app.

- **Cost-Effective Scalability:** Vercel and PlanetScale offer incredibly generous free tiers. Parallel is more than ready to scale to tens of thousands of users.

This was certainly the biggest project I had worked on alone, so, as one would expect, several valuable lessons emerged. The challenges faced, from conceptualization to deployment, offered insights into the intricacies of full-stack development.

Parallel not only achieved the goal of being a platform that fosters educational content creation but also provided a valuable learning experience for my future projects. The journey from conceptualization to launch served as a catalyst for personal and professional growth, reinforcing the idea that thoughtful development and strategic decision-making are essential components of successful projects.
