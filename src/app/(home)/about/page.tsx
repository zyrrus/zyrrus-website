      <h1 className="">About</h1>
      <p className="">
        Hello, I'm Dean Smith, a product designer based in New York City, and I
        currently serve as the Head of Design at Alpha. I'm passionate about
        using design to solve real-world problems and create meaningful
        experiences that enhance people's lives.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        With a bachelor's degree in design from Parsons School of Design, I've
        honed my skills through years of experience as a senior designer at
        various tech companies. I firmly believe that design should be
        user-centric, and I always keep the end-user in mind when creating
        products. My focus at Alpha is on developing products that are both
        functional and aesthetically pleasing.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        When I'm not working, I love to travel and immerse myself in new
        cultures and cuisines. I also stay up-to-date with the latest
        advancements in technology and design by attending conferences and
        workshops.
      </p>

      <p className="">
        I'm proud to be part of the talented team at Alpha and excited about the
        work we've accomplished together. I'm committed to continuing to push
        the boundaries of product design and create products that make a real
        difference in people's lives.
